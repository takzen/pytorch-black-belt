> **From `import torch` to Engineering Mastery.**
> A comprehensive collection of notebooks designed to bridge the gap between "running a model" and understanding the engine underneath.

## 🎯 The Goal

Most tutorials stop at `model.fit()`. This repository starts where they end.
**PyTorch Black Belt** is about understanding the "why" and "how":

- Why does `.view()` throw errors on non-contiguous tensors?
- How do you write a custom Backward pass for a new operation?
- How to debug silent failures that don't throw exceptions but ruin training?
- How to optimize data pipelines when GPU utilization is low?

## 📚 Curriculum: The Path to Mastery

### 🏗️ Module 1: Tensors Deep Dive (Foundations)

_You can't master the model if you don't master the data structure._

- **Broadcasting Dojo:** The math behind dimension expansion.
- **Strides & Memory:** Understanding `storage()`, `view()` vs `reshape()`, and `contiguous()`.
- **Einsum:** The magical function to replace complex matrix ops.
- **In-place Operations:** When `x += 1` saves memory and when it breaks Autograd.

### 🧮 Module 2: Autograd Internals (The Engine)

_Hacking the derivative engine._

- **Computational Graph:** Visualizing dynamic graph construction.
- **`retain_graph=True`:** Use cases beyond the basics.
- **Custom Autograd Functions:** Writing manual `forward` and `backward` methods.
- **Gradient Accumulation:** Simulating large batches on small VRAM.

### 💿 Module 3: Data Engineering (Fuel)

_Garbage In, Garbage Out. Slow In, Slow Training._

- **IterableDataset:** Handling streams and datasets larger than RAM.
- **Custom Collate:** Managing variable-length sequences and padding on the fly.
- **Advanced Sampling:** Balancing imbalanced datasets dynamically.
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Optimizing `num_workers`, `pin_memory`, and prefetching.

### 🧠 Module 4: Advanced Architecture (Construction)

_Building robust and complex systems._

- **Hooks:** Inspecting activations and gradients inside the black box.
- **Initialization Strategies:** Why Xavier and Kaiming matter for convergence.
- **Weight Sharing:** Tying parameters between layers (e.g., Autoencoders).
- **Dynamic Control Flow:** Using Python logic (`if/else`) inside the graph.

### ⚡ Module 5: Training & Optimization (Speed)

_Squeezing every FLOPS out of your GPU._

- **Mixed Precision (AMP):** implementing `fp16` for 2x speedup.
- **Schedulers:** Warmup, Cosine Annealing, and Cyclic Learning Rates.
- **Gradient Clipping:** Preventing exploding gradients in RNNs/Transformers.
- **Torch 2.0:** Mastering `torch.compile` and fusion strategies.

### 📦 Module 6: Ecosystem & Production (Scale)

_Moving from notebook to cluster._

- **PyTorch Lightning:** Structuring code for reproducibility.
- **TorchScript & Tracing:** Exporting models to C++ environments.
- **DDP (Distributed Data Parallel):** Multi-GPU training mechanics.
- **Profiling:** Using PyTorch Profiler to find code bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualizing internals and loss landscapes)

## 🚀 How to Use

You have two options: instant cloud execution or a professional local setup.

### ☁️ Option 1: Google Colab (Zero Setup)

The fastest way to learn. Every notebook in this repository has an **"Open in Colab"** badge at the top.

1.  Open any `.ipynb` file in the file list.
2.  Click the <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab" style="vertical-align: middle"> badge.
3.  The code runs immediately on Google's free GPUs.

### 💻 Option 2: Local Development (VS Code + uv)

Recommended for engineers building their own experimental environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/takzen/pytorch-black-belt.git
    cd pytorch-black-belt
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using uv:**

    ```bash
    # Creates a venv and installs all libraries locked in uv.lock
    uv sync
    ```

    The environment will be automatically configured with exact library versions (PyTorch with CUDA, Scikit-Learn, Transformers, etc.), guaranteeing reproducibility.

3.  **Activate the environment:**

    ```bash
    # Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # Linux/Mac:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    _(Tip: If using VS Code, simply open the `.ipynb` file and select the `.venv` kernel in the top right corner)._

### ⚙️ Customizing CUDA Version (Troubleshooting)

The default project configuration (`uv.lock`) enforces a PyTorch installation with **CUDA 13.0** support. If you have an older NVIDIA GPU or want to run the project on CPU only (e.g., macOS), you must override these settings.

**How to change the version?**

1.  Open the `pyproject.toml` file.
2.  In the `[[tool.uv.index]]` and `[tool.uv.sources]` sections, replace the URL suffix and the index name with your desired version (e.g., `cu126`):

    | Version                 | Index URL (`url`)                        | Required NVIDIA Driver |
    | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
    | **CUDA 13.0** (Default) | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130` | **≥ 575.xx**           |
    | **CUDA 12.6** (Stable)  | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126` | ≥ 560.xx               |
    | **CUDA 12.4** (Legacy)  | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124` | ≥ 550.xx               |
    | **CPU** (No GPU/Mac)    | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`   | None                   |

3.  Update the environment:

    ```bash
    # uv will detect the config change and rebuild uv.lock automatically
    uv sync
    ```
